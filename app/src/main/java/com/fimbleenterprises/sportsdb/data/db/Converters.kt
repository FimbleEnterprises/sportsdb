     * a TypeConverter in order for Room to easily work with it.  We have two choices in how to deal
     * with this scenario.  The first choice would be to simply make the object become a table proper
     * in Room or we can convert the custom object to something SQLite will natively understand.
     *
     * We don't need to wire this up to anything, the @TypeConverter annotation and the
     * parameter/return type will be enough for Room to figure out who needs it.
